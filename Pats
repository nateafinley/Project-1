        <h1>New England Patriots</h1>
        <p>The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The Patriots are one of the most successful teams in NFL history, with a total of six Super Bowl championships, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in league history. They have also won the AFC Championship Game 12 times, and have made 17 appearances in the playoffs since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000.</p>
        <p>The team's iconic colors are navy blue, red, and white, and their mascot is named "Pat Patriot". The Patriots have a large and dedicated fan base known as "Patriots Nation", and their games often sell out quickly.</p>
